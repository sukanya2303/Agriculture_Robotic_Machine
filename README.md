# Agriculture_Robotic_Machine

The problem is the need for an innovative solution to reduce labor work and increase efficiency in agricultural fields, specifically in the ploughing and seed dispensing operations. Traditional methods of farming are time-consuming, prone to errors, and require significant manual labor. To address this issue, a solution is proposed to design and develop an agricultural robotic machine that can perform ploughing and seed dispensing operations with wireless controls and real-time monitoring capabilities. The proposed model's ability to reduce labor work and increase efficiency will significantly impact food production and cost savings for farmers. The solution's effectiveness and usability in real-world field conditions will be ensured through extensive testing and analysis. Ultimately, the development of an agricultural robotic machine will provide an innovative solution to address the challenges faced in traditional farming methods, leading to increased food production and cost savings.
